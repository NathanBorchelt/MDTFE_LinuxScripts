# MDTFE_LinuxScripts

## If you are not u/ALIansEN94, this is unlikely to be of any use to you

Hey u/ALIansEN94, 

This repo is for you, all you need to do with these two scripts is to include the MDTFE_LinuxInstaller.sh with the zip you hand out, and update the version veriable at the top as you itterate.

The MDTFE_Linux.sh file, if you can find some where for it to be part of the standard install that happens with the installer such that it is included MDTFE.exe and the like, that would be easiest and require the least on other end users.
